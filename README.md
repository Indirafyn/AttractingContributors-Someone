# Attracting Contributors
As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

# Requirements

1. Fork this project and then rename the title to your hobby. 
2. Announce the new project and try to attract other members.

# "If you could spend two hours talking to someone, who would you choose?"

So for my project, I absolutely enjoy engaging in conversations with people, learning from their experiences, and exploring the meaning of life. Sometimes, I daydream about having the opportunity to have a direct conversation with individuals like Bill Gates or Oprah Winfrey to satisfy my curiosity. It's all just a playful thought for my SE Class Assignment. However, I'm also interested in knowing from you. Is there someone you particularly love or appreciate? Tell me his/her name. Basically, you don't have to reveal any secrets lol, but if you dont want to mention the name, you can describe that person anonymously and share how they have contributed positively to your life. Let's create a friendly and warm environment where we can laugh and connect.

If you have more time, maybe you can ask him/her a question, text, or whatever through here lol, in hopes that someday this can reach them haha, or if you wish to someone dead (ex. Albert Einstein) it will be another matter....... There is no guarantee!

# Who is he/she?

You can insert any name you prefer, whether it's a real name or an anonymous designation like "flower," "panda," "cat," or any other creative choice. A picture if you want to lol.

2. Open-mindedness: Be open to different perspectives and ideas, encouraging a diverse exchange of thoughts.

3. Have fun and enjoy.
